            <h3>1. Agreement and parties</h3>
            <p>The terms and conditions set forth in these General Terms & Conditions for Epidemic Sound’s User Research Platform (the “Agreement”) apply to your (“You” or “Participant”) participation from time to time in any user/product research, surveys, interviews, usability studies, or any other research activity as defined in relation to a research activity ("Research") conducted by Epidemic Sound AB, company reg. no. 556781-0899, Västgötagatan 2, 118 27 Stockholm, Sweden (”us”, “we” “Epidemic Sound”) through its User Research Program (the “Program”). This Agreement will apply to such participation together with any additional terms and conditions governing a particular Research activity that You have selected to take part in ("Additional Terms"). In the event this Agreement conflicts with any Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will take precedence.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Acceptance</h3>
            <p>By signing up for the Program, clicking "I agree" or otherwise signifying your acceptance of these terms and conditions you are agreeing to be legally bound by this Agreement. You warrant that you are 16 years or older and of legal age in the country where you reside, and that you are authorized to enter into this Agreement. You acknowledge that this Agreement can only be entered into in your capacity as an independent contractor or a registered company in accordance with the rules and regulations where you are situated.</p>

            <h3>3. Amendments</h3>
            <p>Epidemic Sound reserves the right to amend this Agreement from time to time provided that Epidemic Sound will make its best efforts to provide you with no less than fourteen days written notice for any changes that it deems to be material to you. If you do not agree with such changes, you may terminate this Agreement prior to such changes coming into effect by providing written notice to us. By continuing to participate in the Program after such date, you agree to such changes.<p>

            <h3>4. Other applicable terms</h3>
            <p>Any use by you of Epidemic Sound’s music licensing platform or otherwise of Epidemic Sound’s services will be subject to separate terms and conditions as applicable from time to time.</p>

            <h3>5. Confidentiality</h3>
            <p>Any information provided to the Participant, whether directly or to which access is gained, during or as a result of Research, as well as any information which is designated as “Confidential”, “Proprietary” or some similar designation, or that would normally be considered confidential information under the circumstances shall be considered “Confidential Information”. You undertake to keep Confidential Information confidential, that You will not disclose or permit the disclosure of such information to any third person and that You will not use the Confidential Information for any other reason than completing the Research. You agree and acknowledge that your breach or threatened breach of this section may result in irreparable harm to Epidemic Sound, for which money damages would be an insufficient remedy, and therefore Epidemic Sound will be entitled to seek injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of this section. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any information which (a) is in the public domain other than by default of the recipient party; (b) is obtained by the recipient party from a bona fide third party having no restraint on its free right of disposal of such information; or (c) is required to be disclosed by law or applicable regulation or the valid order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or the request or direction of any governmental or other regulatory authority or agency.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Compensation</h3>
            <p>Epidemic Sound may, at its sole discretion, offer a single compensatory reward for a particular, properly completed, Research activity (“Reward”) at each time as and if indicated in relation to a specific Research activity or Additional Terms. Rewards may be offered to only certain selected Participants or to all Participants, as decided by Epidemic Sound at its sole discretion. Any Reward, or the lack thereof, will be the sole and exclusive compensation available to the Participant and therefore the Participant is not entitled to any other remuneration or reimbursement, including for possible expenses, or otherwise in relation to the Research. Rewards are subject to availability. Epidemic Sound reserves the right to substitute the Reward (or any part of it) for a reward of equivalent or greater monetary value if this is necessary for reasons beyond its control. It is the Participant’s responsibility to ensure that accepting a Reward is compliant with its employer’s policy and to inform Epidemic Sound if it is not eligible to receive a reward. Rewards must be claimed no later than 45 days from notification that You are eligible for a Reward for a completed Research activity.
            </p>

            <h3>7. Taxes</h3>
            <p>The Participant is responsible for the payment and the declarative formalities that may arise in respect of all local, federal, state sales taxes, VAT, levies, withholding tax, bank charges, and any other applicable taxes or charges that may apply to/in connection to the Reward. In case of default or failure to respect the payment/declarative formalities obligations in connection with such taxes, we shall not be liable to any incremental taxes, interest or penalties. In particular with respect to the withholding tax that may apply, You shall provide Epidemic Sound with the proof that any applicable withholding tax payment/formalities have been made and that withholding tax have been duly paid to the relevant tax authorities, once done.</p>

            <h3>8. Eligibility / Participation</h3>
            <p>To be eligible for a Reward, a Participant must attend the Research session and follow any instructions provided by Epidemic Sound. Epidemic Sound reserves the right to exclude any Participant from any Research at any time for any reason. If a Research activity session is canceled or terminated prior to proper completion, by You or Us, You will not receive any Reward. Reasons that such a session may be interrupted or terminated includes, but is not limited to, language barriers or constraints, unacceptable background noise or interference, technical difficulties, a failure to follow instructions, if reasonable efforts are not made to complete the task presented or if We suspect that any person has been manipulating a Research activity or has acted unethically in any other way. You may unless explicitly stated otherwise only participate in a Research activity one time. If we suspect that You have participated in a Research activity more than once, You will not be eligible for a Reward. You agree not to use or launch any automated system to respond to a Research activity.
            </p>

            <h3>9. Materials</h3>
            <p>In the event any materials, items or information, including but not limited to documents, instructions, guides, software, are provided to the Participant in relation to the Research, in whatever media ("Materials"), the Participant shall return to Epidemic Sound, or destroy at the request of Epidemic Sound, all such Materials within seven (7) days of completion of the Research.
            </p>

            <h3>10. Rights to feedback</h3>
            <p>You acknowledge and agree that we may use any feedback or suggestions provided by You to Us in connection to Research for any purpose, including to develop Epidemic Sound’s services, without obligation to You. As and if applicable, You grant us an exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable license to any intellectual property rights owned by You in any such feedback or suggestions.

            <h3>16. Severability</h3>
            <p>If any provision of this Agreement is for any reason deemed invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from this Agreement and the invalidity of the provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement. The parties shall replace such provision by one or more valid and enforceable provisions approximating the original intention of the parties as closely as possible
